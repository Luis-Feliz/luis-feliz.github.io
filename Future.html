        <h1><u>SmartBullet (2023)</u></h1>
        <p>
          Originally made in Unity for a game jam being run in my college.
          <br><br> 
          Created movable blocks that become still when you begin to escape. The puzzle revolving around 
          finding the easiest way to move from point A to point B without getting hit by the pellets that 
          the blocks let out.
          <br><br>
          As of now, SmartBullet is being worked on. Making more levels and polishing tutorials as well as
          working on sound effects, music, and models to make offical game to launch on itch.io and steam.
          <br><br>
          UPDATE: Prototype available in <a href="https://luis-feliz.itch.io/smartbullet">Itch.io</a> right now!
