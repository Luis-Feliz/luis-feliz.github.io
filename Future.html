        <h1><u>SmartBullet (2023)</u></h1>
        <p>
          Originally made in Unity for a game jam being run in my college.
          <br><br> 
          Created movable blocks that become still when you begin to escape. The puzzle revolving around 
          finding the easiest way to move from point A to point B without getting hit by the pellets that 
          the blocks let out.
          <br><br>
          As of now, SmartBullet is being worked on. Making more levels and polishing tutorials as well as
          working on sound effects, music, and models to make offical game to launch on itch.io.
