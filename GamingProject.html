        <h1><u>One Way Ticket (2025)</u></h1>
        <p>
          Made in Unity for a 2D Game Development Course as the lead in a team of 5.
          <br><br> 
          Lead the charge for the code in a majority of the game including the 
          movement, scene transitioning, inventory, and enemy spawning code.
          Helped create Music, SFX, and animations for paralaxing the background 
          trees alongside the train art. 
          <br><br>
          UPDATE: Released playable project available in <a href="https://luis-feliz.itch.io/one-way-ticket">Itch.io</a>

        <p>
          Originally made in Unity for a game jam being run in my college.
          <br><br> 
          Created movable blocks that become still when you begin to escape. The puzzle revolving around 
          finding the easiest way to move from point A to point B without getting hit by the pellets that 
          the blocks let out.
          <br><br>
          UPDATE: Prototype available in <a href="https://luis-feliz.itch.io/smartbullet">Itch.io</a> right now!

        <h1><u>Diagnosis Simulator (2023)</u></h1>
        <p>
          Made in Unity for an Internship with Saint Luke's University Hospital 
          as a leader in a team of 6.
          <br><br> 
          Made the animations and helped lead a team of 6 in the engineering, 
          designing, and animating for a client as a means to give an educational 
          VR experience to children and adults who are curious about certain 
          conditions and how they affect the body.

        <h1><u>GrindRunners (2022)</u></h1>
        <p>
          Made in Unity as a side project during the summer inspired by the mobile game craze of Subway Surfers.
          <br><br> 
          Created obstacles that instantiate at random once the platforms reach a certain level. The game would 
          progressively get faster the more points and coins you collect. The game is incomplete, however, the 
          mechanics are fleshed out. Instantiation of platforms also helped in the creation of the paralaxing 
          in OneWayTicket.

        <p>
          Made in Unity for a 3D Game Development Course.
          <br><br> 
          Although not fully complete, contains an inventory and combat system fully 
          coded by me! Containing a turn-based battle system, inventory, and switching cameras 
          inside and outside combat to see and play the games from different angles.
